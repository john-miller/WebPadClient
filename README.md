### WebPad Java Client
This is a sample application written in Java that shows how to consume a Spring Data Rest service.

#### WebPad Documents
The client supports loading documents from the hard disk and the Internet via the WepPad API.

#### UI
This application makes use of both the JavaFX and Swing UI frameworks.  Clients will get the JavaFX UI by default, unless they elect otherwise. Clients that do not support JavaFX will gracefully degrade to the Swing UI.
